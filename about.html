            <p>Teenagers contribute to climate change through their everyday actions, similar to adults, but also possess unique avenues for action. These include energy consumption (like using electronics and transport), waste generation, and dietary choices, all of which have an impact on greenhouse gas emissions and resource depletion.</p>
